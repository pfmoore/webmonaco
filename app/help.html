This web page allows you to run the program <b>Monaco</b> that can be used to
answer a wide range of probability problems, most commonly those arising in dice
and card games.

<P>

Monaco is a program that you can run locally. However, that takes some setting
up. This web page allows you to run the program remotely - even on a device
such as a smartphone that you cannot run Monaco on directly. Most of the
features of Monaco are available, the main exception being that run time is
limited - but you can still do a lot in the time allowed.

<H3>An Example</CENTER></H2>

We start with an example that describes how to use the web page. For this
example we investigate the distribution of an ability score playing the game
<i>Dungeons & Dragons</i>. We start with the usual way to produce such a score:
roll four dice, pick the largest three and add them up. The most straightforward
way to do this in Monaco is using the <i>expression</i>
<span style="font-family: courier">sum(tail3(sorted4d6))</span>.
For now we just assume that this expression works - where to find out how to
write expressions, including that one, is described below.

<P>

To use that expression, we type it - or cut and paste it - into the box labelled
<span style="font-family: helvetica">Expression</span>.
We also select the buttons labelled <span style="font-family: helvetica">-exact</span>
and <span style="font-family: helvetica">-histogram</span> at the top of the page,
and then press the button <span style="font-family: helvetica">Calculate</span>
below the three boxes.

<P>

This gives you 16 lines of output below that button - ignore the final output
lines below the horizontal line, most users won't need those. The first line of
that output is:

<P>

<span style="font-family: courier">&nbsp3&nbsp-&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp1~&nbsp0.000771605&nbsp=&nbsp1/1296</span>

<P>

This line means that there is a probability of 1/1296, or about 0.000771605, of
a score of 3. You might prefer to see that as a percentage. If so, also select
the button labelled <span style="font-family: helvetica">-percent</span> before
pressing <span style="font-family: helvetica">Calculate</span>. In this case the
first line is:

<P>

<span style="font-family: courier">&nbsp3&nbsp-&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp1~&nbsp0.0771605%&nbsp=&nbsp1/1296</span>

<H3>Options</CENTER></H2>

The three buttons labelled <span style="font-family: helvetica">-exact</span>,
<span style="font-family: helvetica">-histogram</span> and
<span style="font-family: helvetica">-percent</span> that have been used
in the example above provide <i>options</i> to the program. There is also a box
labelled <span style="font-family: helvetica">Options</span>; selecting the
button <span style="font-family: helvetica">-exact</span> is exactly the same as
typing <span style="font-family: courier">-exact</span> into that box. You can
do one or the other, but trying to do both will result in the run failing.

<P>

There are many more options than those provided by buttons, which are just the
most commonly used options. You can experiment with the other buttons for the
example above - except that
<span style="font-family: helvetica">-probability</span> is not appropriate, and
at this point do not try using <span style="font-family: helvetica">-new</span>
and always use <span style="font-family: helvetica">-exact</span>. The button
<span style="font-family: helvetica">Program Info</span> actually selects three
options. Some buttons are exclusive - for example selecting
<span style="font-family: helvetica">+statistics</span> cancels
<span style="font-family: helvetica">-statistics</span>, and vice versa.

<H3>Tutorial</CENTER></H2>

There is a <a href="http://www.mnemosyne.uk/monaco/Monaco%20Tutorial.pdf">tutorial</a>
for the program, but to use it you need to understand the difference between
how you would run a local copy of the program, and how you use this web page.

<P>

Monaco is a command line program. You run it by putting first the options, then
the expression - and sometimes a third kind of parameter that the box
<span style="font-family: helvetica">Number</span> is for - on a command line.
Thus the first example above corresponds to the command line:

<P>

<span style="font-family: courier">monaco -exact -histogram sum(tail3(sorted4d6))</span>

<P>

where <span style="font-family: courier">monaco</span> is a placeholder for what
you actually need to type, which depends on your system. The tutorial describes
use of the program only in this way. To use examples in the tutorial you must
put the options into the <span style="font-family: helvetica">Options</span> box
- or use buttons where available - and put the expression into the
<span style="font-family: helvetica">Expression</span> box. Until you reach the
material on approximate runs near the end of the tutorial, leave the
<span style="font-family: helvetica">Number</span> box empty. (When you reach
that point, do not select <span style="font-family: helvetica">-exact</span>,
put the number of evaluations in the
<span style="font-family: helvetica">Number</span> box, and you can experiment
with the option <span style="font-family: courier">-new</span>.)

<P>

The most important thing in the tutorial that is not either described above or
can be found by experimentation with the buttons, is how to write useful
expressions. However, the tutorial also describes some additional options, in
particular how to use the option
<span style="font-family: courier">-probability</span>.

<P>

The tutorial is one of the immediately available documents for the program,
others include two further tutorials. For all of these see
<a href="http://www.mnemosyne.uk/monaco/">here</a>. If you receive the
program - contact the author as described there - there is also extensive full
documentation - most of which most users will not need, the tutorials alone
will probably suffice.
