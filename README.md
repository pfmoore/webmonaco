# Monaco for the Web

A simple front end for the monaco game simulation application.

Built with Python's flask library. The app is a simple HTML front page
(which can be copied and hosted anywhere, with only the backend URL needing to be changed)
and a backend web service that runs monaco as a standalone process.
